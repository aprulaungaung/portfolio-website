						<h2 class="front-news__headline">The pandemic has allowed us to see so much. What will we do with our newfound clarity?</h2>

						<p class="front-news__text">From government systems to family units to our own psyches, the pandemic brought revelation. What will we change?A retreating ocean is often the first sign of a tsunami. The water along the shoreline is dragged back dramatically, exposing parts of the shore and seabed that are normally underwater.

It’s helpful to frame the first two years of the pandemic in similar terms to this ocean drawback. Detaching from our own specific circumstances, and our own specific pandemic pain, we have a unique opportunity to actually see the metaphorical seafloor of the world.</p>

						<p class="front-news__text">

Exposed by the pandemic were the often invisible systems that organise our society. These systems are comprised of everything from the expectations of ongoing and unlimited growth via the systems of capitalism and globalisation, to the systems of class, systemic racism and patriarchy, to the more localised systems of government and public service, to the social systems of the nuclear family and individuals, and how our communities, cities, households and green spaces are organised.Also exposed in the drawback of two pandemic years has been our internal seafloor – that of our own psyches.

We got to see what we are made of, with previously unimaginable circumstances creating a chance to really test ourselves, see where we fracture and where we are strong.

Just like a tsunami, we can expect further devastation to come. But this exposure of our systems could also show us how to rebuild stronger.

So what did we see when the virus exposed what’s underpinning our lives and our very selves? And what will we do with this newfound clarity?

Economics writer George Megalogenis wrote that the “wicked genius” of Covid was to seek out where the holes and gaps were in our open economic model. In his Quarterly Essay titled Exit strategy: politics after the pandemic, Megalogenis identified that the weak points in Australia’s pandemic response were in the areas that the government had privatised.</p>
